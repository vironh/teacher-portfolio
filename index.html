                        This part-time job provided me with insight into the psychology behind child and adolescent
                        development. As mentioned in the Profile
                        section of my resume, one of my focus areas while studying education, was psychology. Therefore,
                        it is no surprise that I wanted to learn more about this field outside of the context of teaching. 
                        I did not interact with any of the patients in person, but was given insight into their lives, 
                        development and individual progress through recorded videos that I had to watch in order to transcribe 
                        them into textual dialogues. The aim of these transcribes were to form part of a study performed by the
                        psychologist on the unique challenges facing children and adolescents and how it affects their 
                        interpersonal development. She later published a book, <i> Goodness and Kindness – A Currency for Success </i>, 
                        on the research she conducted during this study.

                        This was a hybrid remote job that I started while I was in my final year of studies. It gave me
                        experience in a completely unrelated field.
                        I learned how to work meticulously, in an organized manner under high-pressure conditions. The
                        fact
                        that it was a remote job also helped me
                        to practice my telephonic and email communication skills, conflict management and
                        problem-solving
                        skills.
                        I also picked up many new skills in basic computer programs and applications, which all turned
                        out
                        to be useful as a teacher who regularly
                        has to set up marksheets with complex calculations to assess learner progress.

            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <img src="Viron.jpg" alt="Photograph of Teacher">
            <p>
                I am a passionate and dedicated intermediate and senior division teacher (Grades 7-12) with a Bachelor of
                Education degree, which I passed with
                distinction at the University of South Africa. My teachable subjects are Biology, English (first language)
                and Psychology (which was applied in
                South Africa in a subject called Life Orientation that covers topics like career guidance, physical
                education, health and hygiene education as
                well as philosophy and theology). Additionally I can teach Technology and Art History up to grade 9 level.
                With almost 9 years of teaching experience, I have progressed rapidly in my career, having been promoted
                each year during my time at an educational
                institution where I worked while studying full-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting out as an aftercare teacher for Grades 6-7, a reading specialist and language tutor, then
                progressing to a substitute, and later an
                assistant teacher of Visual Arts and Languages, all while studying full time, I have honed my skills and
                proven my ability to work well under
                pressure. Since graduating in 2019, I have served as a senior division teacher of Biology at a public
                school, High school Gerrit Maritz, in one of
                South Africa's three capital cities, Pretoria.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at High school Gerrit Maritz, I was quickly promoted to Subject Coordinator, Grade Head for
                the Grade 10 group, and served on the
                School Management Team. My experience teaching in a multicultural, multilingual, and multiracial
                environment, coupled with my management expertise,
                passion for teaching, and eagerness to learn and adapt to a progressive education system, makes me an asset
                to any educational institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since moving to Canada, I have worked at an International School as a teacher of Science and Biology, as
                well as an Outdoor Education centre. Both
                of these use the Ontario Curriculum, which has allowed me to become familiarised with the education system
                here.
